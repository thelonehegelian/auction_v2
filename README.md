# Auction Contract

**Note to the assessor** 
- the code is over-commented, but that is just for the assignment, please excuse that

## Description and Logic

- Allows a user to create an auction with a list of items
- Allows other users to bid on items in the auction
- There is a time limit for the auction, which is fixed for now but perhaps should be set at `createBid`
- Once the auction has ended no more bids are taken
- `findHighestBidder` is used to find the highest bid nothin else is done at the end of the auction
- Using `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin, it allows for transferring ownership
- Apart from some basic restrictions and checks, for the purpose of the assignment, I am assuming that the creator of the auction would not act maliciously (though obviously they can). I have commented where I think it might be possible

### Functions
- `createAuction` -> Allows the owner to create an auction with a list of items
- `placeBid` -> Allows users to place bids on the items
  - each higher bid removes the highest bidder from the Item struct and returns their money
- `findHighestBidder` -> Finds the highest bidder for each item
- `_transferToPrevBidder` -> A private helper function to transfer to losing bidder
- `_createItemList` -> A private helper function to create an array of items
- Test helper functions, please see comment in the contract file
### Events
- Events can be useful for Frontend, and an Auction contract is likely to be a Frontend application 
- `AuctionCreated`
- `BidPlaced`
- `AuctionEnded` 
### Errors
- Custom errors can cost quite a bit of gas 
- For `revert` the same OPCODE is used as with `require` since the update (think it was couple of years ago)

### Restrictions
- To set access control I am using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract. It probably costs more gas (?)
  - Simple modifier would work too in such a simple contract but generally my rule is to use an audited contract where possible
  - Ownable contracts could have their ownership transferred so that is handy in this particular case

- Contract deployer is set as the `owner` of the contract
- Only owner of the contract can create a new auction 
- Only non-owners can call the `placeBid` function
- OnlyOwner can call the `findHighestBidder` function (assuming that this would be called for the frontend only), can also be made to use to settle auction
- `findHighestBidder` cannot be called unless the auction time is up

# Tests
- There are test helper functions in the contract. I usually don't do it like this but in this case I needed to be quick to make sure everything worked as intended
1. Contract has an owner that is the deploer of the contract
2. Only owner of the contract can create a new auction
3. Auction is created successfully
4. Owner of the contract (creator of auction) is not allowed to place a bid
5. Bids less than the previous high bid or less than starting price are not allowed
6. New high bid is updated as well as the highest bidder, and the eth is refunded to the losing bidder
7. Does not allow bids after auction time is up
8. Does not allow settlement if the auction has not ended. Does not allow non-owners to call `findHighestBidder`
9. Finds the highest bidders and returns the address and itemId

# Gas optimization
- Custom error messages are usually cheaper than require strings
- Possible to make `public` functions `external` to save gas
- Use of  unchecked { i += 1; } in for loop. There is no real risk of overflow in this case
- Enabled compiler optimizer in hardhat.config.js. It usually saves a lot of gas

# Things would have like to try
- Would have liked to add a Factory contract. Usually such contracts come with Factory contracts to allow various users to create different contracts of the same type. The basic Factory contract is there in the contracts folder but I did not implement
- ERC20 support 
- Liked to have used an Oracle to set prices in USD or even a sort of NFT barter system
- Would be nice to use NFT representation for each item 
- For better user experience gas cost can probably reduced more, using bytes instead of strings etc.
- Sell certain quantity of items, with each piece sold the price of the item increases by a percentage
- Allow bidders to set a maximum bid as well i.e. how high they are willing to go. Would save them gas cost of trying to constantly outbid
- Maybe some prevention against sniping bots(?)
- Allow for a reserve price to be set at the start of the auction
- If starting price is not moved within a specific period of time the bid is lowered by a certain amount
- Dutch auction type
